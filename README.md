# Cs50-Final-Project
My final project for Cs50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## Distinctiveness and Complexity:
This project was very challanging for me. For the first time, I created a project completely from scratch and by myself.
When creating Pollapp, I used almost everything I learned during the course, and even more. 
In the project, in addition to the previously known python, django, javascript, html, css, I also used: Django REST framework which helped me create an API, Bulma which helped me make the website look good and Chart.js which helped me make graphs for polls
